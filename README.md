dotfiles
========

Repo contains my personal config files that reside in the home dir.
There is also a script taken from [this script](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles/blob/master/makesymlinks.sh) that first backs up the existing config files and then creates symlinks  from the home directory to these files. 

sysctl.conf should be appended to /etc/sysctl.conf Settings are taken from [this blog post](https://tobert.github.io/post/2014-06-24-linux-defaults.html) Article is backed up [here](https://gist.github.com/sanislav/46760f3d8f4a07f2ee90)
