dotfiles
========

Repo contains my personal config files that reside in the home dir.
There is also a script taken from https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles/blob/master/makesymlinks.sh that first backs up the existing config files and then creates symlinks  from the home directory to these files.
